\section{Introduction} \label{Intro}
	Traditionally malware authors have targeted personal computers, workstations and servers. Mainly because they were potentially rich stores of sensitive information. Mobile phones however were mainly used for communication and did not offer much incentive. Over the last decade there has been a significant shift in computing from Desktops to mobile computing devices. Smartphones and tablets make up for a large share of the mobile computing market\cite{smartphone-market}. The growing popularity of these devices have caught the attention of malware writers. People have come to rely on their mobile devices for activities such as e-commerce, communication, data storage, navigation etc. This growing trend is something that is being actively exploited by cyber criminals \cite{kaspersky-cybercrime} \cite{symantec-cybercrime}. Security evaluations have revealed the ease and extent to which malware can be developed for different smartphone platforms \cite{mylonas2011smartphone} \cite{schmidt2010smartphone} \cite{grimes2012apple}.

	In the pre-smartphone era mobile phone vendor used its own proprietary operating system and the phones capabilities itself were limited. Most applications for these devices were developed by the vendors in-house and a rare few by third party developers. The limited attack surface and diversity of platforms made it harder to develop malware that simultaneously targeted multiple devices. Unlike the pre-smartphone era, smartphones today have far greater capabilities from their sophisticated hardware and their constantly improving platforms. Platform capabilities are exposed via APIs which allow applications to be developed by third party vendors. The majority of smartphones today run on one of the three platforms which are Android\cite{android-home}, iOS\cite{iOS-home} and Windows Phone\cite{WindowsPhone-home}. As of Q1 2015, Android holds the largest market share at 78.0\%, followed by iOS with 18.3\% with Windows Phone, BlackBerry and others making up for the remaining 3.7\% share \cite{idc-smartphone-marketshare}. This standardization of platforms has helped not just application developers but also malware authors.
	
	This report is organized as follows, we begin with an introduction to smartphone malware in Section \ref{Intro}. Section \ref{related_work} provides a background on the evolution of smartphone malware and related work on its detection. In Section \ref{platforms} we describe the architecture and security models of popular smartphone platforms and survey the malware landscape for each platform. Section \ref{process} presents a generalized approach to analysing smartphone malware, which we proceed to specialize for Android malware analysis in Section \ref{android_malware_analysis}. Section \ref{limitations} describes some of the limitations of our approach and possible methods to overcome them. Finally in Section \ref{conculsion} we conclude by summarizing the report.
	
\section{Background} \label{related_work}
This section describes work that has been done on malware analysis for desktops and personal computers and the evolution of malware analysis for smartphones. This would include the investigation process, sandboxes and automated tools.\\
We also talk about the challenges with smartphone malware analysis	
\subsection{Malware attack goals}
Suarez-Tangil et al.\cite{suarez2014evolution} categorised malware based on their attack goal and behaviour, method of distribution and privilege acquisition.\\\\
Attack goals and behaviour are summarised as
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[]{\textbf{Fraud:} Such as sending SMS/Calling premium numbers or holding device data or functionality ransom.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Sabotage:} Such as destroying data or rendering the device unusable.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Theft:} Exfiltration of user information (contact lists, messages, IMEI/IMSI numbers, call/location history etc) and/or user credentials (banking, social accounts, email, corporate accounts)}
	\item[]{\textbf{SPAM:} Agressive Adware}
	\item[]{\textbf{Service Misuse:} Such as snooping, spying or tracking of the user by exploiting device sensors. Another example is running a botnet without the users knowledge.}\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Modes of distribution}
Methods of distribution and infection were categorized as follows
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[]{\textbf{Market to Device:} An attacker uses an app market to upload his/her malicious application. If markets are not policed for malicious content users are at risk of getting infected.}
	\item[]{\textbf{App to Device:} In this mode of distribution the attacker uses a vulnerable application to distribute his/her malicious application.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Web to Device:} This mode of distribution exploits vulnerabilities in web browsers to distribute malicious content.}
	\item[]{\textbf{SMS to Device:} Malware uses SMS/MMS to distribute malicious payloads. This was a popular strategy targeting the SymbianOS.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Network to Device:} This strategy exploits platform vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Distribution uses either Device to Device (D2D) propagation or Cloud to Device (C2D) propagation.}
	\item[]{\textbf{USB to Device:} Malware infects devices when they are connected to an infected computer via a communication port usually USB.}\\
\end{enumerate}
Privilege acquisition is generally achieved via two methods
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[]{\textbf{User Manipulation:} An unsuspecting is tricked into granting privileges to malware. User manipulation is achieved via Social Engineering, use of repackaged applications from third-party sources, etc.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Technical Exploitation:} Here privileges are acquired by exploiting platform vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Although vulnerabilities differ across platforms, most common attacks include API vulnerabilities, buffer overruns, injection attacks, protocol vulnerabilities etc.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Malware capabilities} \label{capabilities}
Faruki et al. \cite{farukiandroid} categorised malware based on their capabilities within the context of smartphones.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{\textbf{Trojan:} Malicious apps that appear to have a benign purpose to the user, while performing harmful activities without the user being aware. Trojans are typically used in the exfiltration of sensitive data such as user credentials, contacts, messages etc. SMS Trojan families send SMS's to premium rate numbers without the user being aware.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Backdoors:} This type of malware infects systems exploiting platform weaknesses. Backdoors typically use root exploits to escalate privileges and evade detection.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Worm:} Malicious apps that create copies of itself which it distributes to other systems via networks and/or removable media.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Botnets:} These apps compromise the device to create a Bot, which forms part of a network of other such bots called a botnet. Bots are controlled by a Command and Control server and are used for malicious activities ranging from data exfiltration to denial of service attacks.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Spyware:} These apps perform malicious activites such as monitoring calls, contacts, messages, location, etc. It can also send this data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Adware:} These apps spam the user with unsolicited advertisements and notifications. These can create shortcuts on the home screen, steal bookmarks, and impair effective usage of the device.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Randsomware:} This type of malware locks the user out of his/her data and demands a ransom to unlock the data.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current research in Malware detection}
Malware analysis for desktops and laptops has been well established. There is a wealth of tools for both static and dynamic analysis. Sophisticated methods for automated analysis have also been proposed and implemented \cite{willems2007toward} \cite{xie2013ipanda} as well as a technical vocabulary for malware analysis \cite{kirillov2011malware}.
Smartphone malware analysis however is still maturing and is predominantly towards Android. Security researchers have made significant progress in trying to study smartphone malware. Surveys and taxonomical studies\cite{zhou2012dissecting} \cite{amamra2012smartphone} \cite{suarez2014evolution} have been carried out by researchers on the malware landscape. Others have proposed tools and analytics \cite{wu2012droidmat} \cite{zheng2013droid} \cite{blasing2010android} \cite{li2012android} \cite{reina2013system} \cite{tam2015copperdroid} to detect malware. 

\section{Smartphone Platforms} \label{platforms}
\subsection{Android}
Android is an open source smartphone operating system being currently developed and maintained by Google Inc. and promoted by the Open Handset Alliance (OHA). Android was originally conceived by Andy Rubin, Chris White, Nick Sears and Rich Miner at Android Inc in October 2003. Android Inc was later acquired by Google Inc in August 2005. The Open Handset Alliance is a consortium of 84 companies led by Google consisting of mobile handset manufactures, software developers, chipset manufactures and a few telecommunication companies \cite{open-hadset-alliance}.

\subsubsection{Ecosystem}
The first Android smartphone was the HTC Dream running Android 1.0 released in September 2008, followed by an upgrade to Android 1.1 in February 2009. From version 1.5 onwards Android releases were codenamed with names of deserts and pastries. The table below summarises the different Android releases and their codenames.

	\hline %a line at the bottom
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The ecosystem is not just about the distribution of andriod versions but also comprises of hardware vendors, carriers and developers. Hardware vendors consists of CPU manufacturers, System-On-Chip(SoC) manufacturers and device manufactures.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{\textbf{CPU Manufacturers:} A majority of Android devices run on an ARM architecture based processor due to its low power consumption. ARM Holdings does not manufacture CPUs but licences its technology as intellectual property. The ARMv7 instruction set is common in todays android smartphones.
	In 2011, Google partnered with Intel to support Intel processors on Android. Intel started the Android on Intel Architecture (Android-IA) project to enable Android on Intel processors. Like ARM, MIPS Technologies has licensed its processor architecture designs to other manufacturers. MIPS based proccessors are found in tablets, set-top boxes, media players etc.}
	\item[]{\textbf{SoC Manufactures:} System-On-Chip are components that include a CPU, GPU, RAM, I/O controllers, baseband processors all included on a single silicon chip. Manufacturing SoCs are more cost effective and power efficient as compared to individual components. The main SoC families are Tegra from nVidia, OMAP from Texas Instruments, Exynos from Samsung and Snapdragon from Qualcomm.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Device Manufactures:} The final handset the consumers purchase is designed and built by device manufacturing companies. Some well known companies include Samsung, LG, Motorola, HTC and Sony. Device manufactuers tend to customize the Android framework to differentiate themselves from the competition. However these customizations could lead to vulnerabilities in the Android framework. Since the Android framework is licenced under the Apache 2.0 Licence, modified binaries can be redistributed without releasing the source code.}
\end{itemize}

Carriers provide voice and data services to smartphone customers. Some carriers also partner with device manufacturers to provide phone deals to customers. Carrier deals customize the phones firmware before being made available to customers.

Lastly developers form a significant part of the Android ecosystem. Developers contribute to the Android project as well as building applications for the Android platform. Some android enthusiasts also develop custom firmware projects also known as ROMs for different android devices. The most popular of these projects is CyanogenMod \cite{cyanogenmod}.

\subsubsection{Software Stack}
The Android platform architecture consists of five components \ref{fig_android_stack}. Android applications, the Android framework, the Android Runtime, User-space native code and the Linux kernel.
\begin{figure}[h]\label{fig_android_stack}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{android_stack}
\centering
\caption{Android platform architecture\cite{android_stack}} 
\end{figure}

At the top of the software stack are the Android applications. Application developers use the Android API to build applications that the end user interacts with. Applications found on a device are either system apps which come installed with the stock OS and user installed apps which can be installed from the Google Play Store or other sources.
The Android Framework provides application developers a rich API to access the devices capabilities. The framework allows developers to manage UI interaction, access to media storage, access to device peripherals such as the baseband controller, camera, GPS, wifi controllers, inter process communication, etc.
The Android Framework and Android applications are developed in Java. Applications are compiled into Dalvik Executables (or dex files) which are then interpreted by the DalvikVM. The DalvikVM is a register based virtual machine that executes applications written for Android. The DalvikVM forms an integral part of the Android Runtime and provides a layer of abstraction to the underlying operating system. Android 4.4 (KitKat) introduced a new runtime called Android Run Time (ART) as an experimental alternative. Unlike Dalvik which used Just-In-Time compilers to convert dex bytecode into native code, ART uses Ahead-Of-Time compilers to compile the application into native code upon their installation. In Android 5.0 ART replaced Dalvik as the sole Android runtime.
In addition to the Android Framework, developers can access system services (eg. dhcpd, wpa\_supplicant,etc) and system libraries(eg bionic libc, WebKit, OpenSSL, etc) via user-space native code components. These components allow access to services and libraries that talk directly to the Linux kernel and avoid the overhead of the Android Runtime. Low-level native code operations are employed when application performance is paramount.
The final component of the Android stack is the Linux kernel. The kernel has been modified to operate smartphone hardware. Kernel drivers control device peripherals, network components, process management and file system access. Some of the android specific kernel drivers are wakelocks for power management, ashmem for anonymous shared memory, alarms, paranoid networking and Binder. Paranoid networking and Binder are important from a security perspective as the former restricts access to network sockets to applications based on their permission set and the latter implements Inter Process Communication (IPC) and an associated security mechanism.

\subsubsection{Application structure and components}
Android applications are distributed in via APK (Android PacKage) files. An apk is a zip archive of several files and folders. An android application package has a folder structure as shown in \ref{fig_apk_struct}
\begin{figure}[h] \label{fig_apk_struct}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{apk_structure}
	\centering
	\caption{Android package structure\cite{apk_structure}} 
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{\textbf{AndroidManifest.xml:} This file includes the application meta-data such as package name, minimum and maximum supported API level, permissions requested, libraries used and application components such as Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers and Content Providers.}
	\item[]{\textbf{classes.dex:} This file contains the Dalvik bytecode to be executed by the DalvikVM.}
	\item[]{\textbf{META-INF:} This folder contains the application certificate and a list of files included in the apk along with their SHA-1 hashes.}
	\item[]{\textbf{lib:} This folder contains native binaries that the application uses. These binaries are stored in sub-folders, created for each supported CPU architecture.}
	\item[]{\textbf{assets:} This folder contians application assets that can be retrieved by the AssetManager class.}
	\item[]{\textbf{res:} This folder contains resources that are not compiled into the resources.arsc file. These include icons, images, UI layouts, menus, etc.}
	\item[]{\textbf{resources.arsc:} This file contains resources that are pre-compiled, for example application strings.}
\end{itemize}

\FloatBarrier

Having discussed the package structure we now look at the top level components of an android application. App components are entry points for the system to access the application. There are four different components with a distinct lifecycle. These are summarised below \cite{android-fundamentals}.
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{\textbf{Activities:} These components make up the user interface of the application. An application can have more than one Activity and these are all listed in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Activities are also capable of returning results to its caller.}
\item[]{\textbf{Services:} Services are similar to Unix daemons performing background tasks without the need for user interaction. Services usually performing long-running operations or operations for remote processes. For example playing audio in the background or downloading data over the internet.} 
\item[]{\textbf{Broadcast Receivers:} These components listen to events generated by the Android Operating system or application broadcast  events. Examples of system generated broadcast events are BOOT\_COMPLETED, SMS\_RECIEVED, etc.} 
\item[]{\textbf{Content Providers:} These components provide an interface to allow sharing of stored data with other applications. Data stored on the file system, Cloud, databases etc can be queried via Content Providers. An example the Android system provides a Content Provider to access the users contacts.}
\end{itemize} 

Activities, Services and Broadcast Receivers are activated via asynchronous messages called Intents. Intents request a particular action from a component and may specify the URI of data to act on. Content Providers are not activated via Intents, rather they are activated when targeted by a request.

\subsubsection{Security model}
This section just summarises the most significant aspects of the android security model extracted from \cite{Drake:2014:AHH:2614422}, \cite{Elenkov:2014:ASI:2631372} and \cite{Tyrone:2015:MAHH}
\paragraph{\textbf{Permission model}}
Android uses two distinct but co-operating permission models as part of its security model. These two models are enforced by the Linux kernel and the other by the Android Runtime and Framework. The Linux kernel uses users and groups to enforce permissions on the file system and other android resources. This permission model is commonly refereed to as the Android Sandbox.\\
The Android Runtime and Framework defines a set of permissions which limit the abilities of the application. These permissions are listed in the AndroidManifest.xml file and are first displayed to the user when the application is installed. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Android Sandbox}}
Like traditional Linux platform Android uses user ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) paradigm, however it does not have a \textit{passwd} or \textit{group} files. It was reasoned that there would be only one user to the system (i.e. the owner of the smartphone) and so the UIDs were assigned to individual applications known as Android IDs (AID), instead of to each user on the system. Certain AIDs are reserved for privileged and system-critical applications such as those belonging to the system/user group. Like in Linux each process has its own memory space and cannot interfere with another running process. In addition to process isolation the Android Sandbox also achieves data isolation by assigning a each application a dedicated data directory with read and write permissions.

\paragraph{\textbf{Android Permissions}}
In order to allow access to hardware, system services, data storage, Internet connectivity etc., Android grants additional access rights by way of \textit{API Permissions}. Permissions requested by an application are listed in the AndroidManifest.xml file. These permissions are granted to the application at the time of installation and once granted cannot be revoked. Some API permissions map to low-level kernel permissions for example the API permission \textit{android.permission.INTERNET} which grants the application access to the Internet maps to the kernel managed group \textit{inet} which grants users the ability to open sockets. Felt et. al. developed \textit{Stowaway} to detect over-privileged Android applications \cite{felt2011android}. 

\paragraph{\textbf{Protection Levels}}
Each API permission has an associated \textit{protection level}. Some permissions are more sensitive than others and protection levels define the conditions under which the applications are granted permissions. The table below summarises the four protection levels defined by Android.
\begin{center} 
	\begin{tabular}{|cp{0.5\textwidth}|cp{0.5\textwidth}|}      
		\hline 
		Protection Level & Description \\
		\hline 
		normal & This is the default protection level and generally associated with permissions that have a low risk to the system and other applications  \\
		\hline
		dangerous &  Permissions that could allow access to sensitive data or access the devices hardware, have a protection level set as dangerous. \\
		\hline
		signature & Permissions with this protection level are only granted to applications that have been signed by the same key as the application that declared the permission. \\
		\hline
		signatureOrSystem &  Permissions with this protection level are granted to applications that have either the same signing key or are part of the system image.\\

		\hline %a line at the bottom
	\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

\paragraph{\textbf{Code signing}}
Android mandates that every application be signed before it can be installed on the system. Signing is done with digital certificates whose private key is held by the authors of the application. Code signing establishes an identity of the author of the application and provides a degree of trust with other aspects of the security framework.\\
Digital certificates can be self-signed and need not be issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) as the system does not verify certificates. Certificates are used by the Android system to perform comparisons with other applications claimed to be developed by the same author and when accepting updates for an application. This prevents forged updates and applications from being granted the same permissions associated with that certificate.

\subsubsection{Current malware landscape}
The earliest documented Android malware were FakePlayer and DroidSMS, discovered in August 2010. Since then several researchers have surveyed android malware and their evolution \cite{felt2011survey}\cite{zhou2012dissecting}\cite{farukiandroid}\cite{le2013analysis}\cite{android_malware_analysis}. Zhou et. al \cite{zhou2012dissecting} created the Android Malware Genome project\cite{android_malware_genome} in an effort to characterize existing malware in order to aid the research community.

We provide a brief chronology of the most significant malware families from 2010 to 2015 Q1\cite{current_android_malware} and the security weaknesses that facilitated their infection.

\subsection{iOS}
iOS is a propriety operating system developed and maintained by Apple Inc. for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices. The first commercially released version of iOS was for the iPhone in 2007. It was then extended to support iPod Touch, iPad in 2010 and iPad mini in 2012. The first release of iOS formerly known as iPhone OS was a derivation of OS X and shares its base with the Darwin\cite{Darwin}. iPhone OS was developed by the Macintosh team at Apple lead by Scott Forstall. It was initially intended to allow developers to build web applications to run as native iPhone apps. In 2008 Apple released the first native Software Development Kit for iPhone OS. In 2010 iPhone was rebranded as iOS, which at the time of writing held the second largest share of the smartphone market.   

\subsubsection{Ecosystem}
The iOS ecosystem consists of iOS devices manufactured by Apple, the operating system itself and iOS application developers. Unlike Google's Android, iOS is not licensed to third party hardware manufactures. The manufacturing of some components that go into the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch are outsourced to third party manufactures but the final product is assembled at Apple factories.

The table below lists the various releases of iOS and the corresponding iPhone and iPad model that it was released with.
\begin{center} 
	\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}

\end{center}

\subsubsection{Software Stack}
The iOS architecture consists of five layers, iOS applications, the Cocoa Touch layer, the Media layer, the Core Services and the Core OS layer (iOS kernel) Fig.\ref{ios_software_stack}. At the very top is the application layer the system and third party apps. iOS apps can be classified into three types. Native apps that use the publicly accessible Objective-C Framework, Web based applications that typically run within Safari, which is the default web browser, or a hybrid app which uses a combination of native and web app features. iOS applications are written in Objective-C and linked to the iOS SDK and Cocoa Touch framework.\\
The Cocoa Touch layer defines the User Interface of the application. Cocoa Touch is a collection of related frameworks which enable key technologies such as multitasking, touch-based input, push notifications, sharing content and documents, gesture recognition etc. Below the Cocoa Touch layer lies the Media layer. This layer provides services that use audio, video and graphics libraries. This framework provides support to many industry-standard audio and video formats.\\
The Core Services layer controls the Objective-C runtime and fundamental system services and applications. Some of the services this layer provides are accounts and telephony basaed services, multipeer conectivity services, iCloud storage, Data protection and File Sharing support. At the bottom of the software stack is the Core OS layer which is the iOS kernel. iOS uses the XNU kernel which is also used in Mac OS X. This layer creates an abstraction to the underlying hardware. Apps don't directly access this layer however the frameworks used by the app interact with this layer\cite{ios_layers}.

\FloatBarrier
\subsubsection{Application structure and components}
iOS applications are distributed via IPA files which are basically archives that have the .ipa extension. Uncompressing the archive reveals the following folder structure \ref{fig_ipa_structure}.
The Payload folder contains the iOS application bundle which is a folder with the applications name and suffixed with the .app extension, in this example its AppName.app.\\
AppName.app contains application binary, static resource files and additional application metadata. The iTunesArtwork file is a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file that is used as the apps icon in iTunes and the App Store.\\
The iTunesMetadata.plist contians application meta-data such as developers name, bundle identifier and copyright information \cite{Tyrone:2015:MAHH}.

\subsubsection{Security model}
iOS has been designed with security at its core. The hardware and software are designed to work in tandem to provide maximum security without compromising on user experience. Apple has published a document detailing the iOS security internals\cite{apple_ios_security_internals} and its salient features are summarised below.
\paragraph{\textbf{Security Architecture}}
Security in iOS is built into the hardware and software stack. Fig \ref{fig_ios_security_arch} shows us various components that make up the security architecture.\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{Secure Boot: Each component of the boot chain is cryptographically signed by Apple to ensure its integrity. If any component of the boot process fails the chain of trust verification, the boot process is aborted and the device enters DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode. The device must then be restored to factory default settings by connecting to iTunes.\\
	At the start of the boot process, the processor executes code from read-only Boot ROM. The Boot ROM is an immutable section of code that contains the Apple Root CA public key. The Boot ROM along with the public key is laid down during the chip fabrication process and is trusted implicitly. The Low-Level Bootloader (LLB) is the next component in the boot chain to be loaded once its signature has been verified by the Boot ROM. Once the LLB has finished executing it verifies and loads the next-stage bootloader, iBoot which in turn verifies and loads the iOS kernel.\\
	The secure boot chain ensures the integrity of low level components to prevent tampering and allows iOS to run only on validated Apple devices.}
	\item[]{System Software Authorization: This is a process used by iOS to upgrade the device with software updates and security patches. This process also prevents devices from being downgraded to older version so as to exploit a vulnerability in an unpatched version.\\
	System Software Authorization is done either via iTunes where a full copy of iOS is downloaded and installed, or over the air (OTA) updates where only affected components are downloaded and installed. During the upgrade the device connects to the Apple installation authorization server and sends it a list of cryptographic measurements for each component being upgraded, a random nounce for prevent replay attacks and the device's unique ID (ECID). The authorization server validates the list of measurements to check if upgrades are permitted. It then adds the ECID to the measurement and signs the result. Signed upgrades are then sent to the device from the server.\\
	The boot time chain-of-trust evaluation verifies that the signature comes from Apple and that the measurements of the items loaded from the disk, combined with the ECID match what was sent by the server.}
	\item[]{Secure Enclave: The Apple A7 and later A-series processors have a coprocessor fabricated in called the Secure Enclave. The coprocessor has its own secure boot process and personalized software upgrade process. It provides all cryptographic operations for Data Protection key management and maintains the integrity of Data Protection even if the kernel is compromised.\\
	It uses encrypted memory and has a built in random number generator. Communication with the application processor is achieved via an isolated interrupt-driven mailbox and shared memeory data buffers. Each Secure Enclave chip is provisioned with its own UID (unique ID) during fabrication and is inaccessible to other parts of the system. On system boot up an ephemeral key is created, entangled with its UID and used to encrypt the Secure Enclave's portion of memory space. Also the data saved to the file system by Secure Enclave is encrypted with a key entangled with the UID and an anti-replay counter.}
	\item[]{Touch ID: This is the fingerprint sensing technology that makes secure access faster and easier. Touch ID although not a replacement for passcodes overcomes the inconvenience of having to frequently enter long passcodes to unlock the device.\\
	Touch ID is a form of user authentication that can also be used to approve purchases from the iTunes Store, the App Store and the iBoot Store.}

\FloatBarrier
\paragraph{\textbf{Encryption and Data protection}}
Even if the underlying security infrastructure is compromised, iOS has additional encryption and data protection features to safeguard user data. These features are summarised below
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{Hardware security features: Every iOS devices has a dedicated AES 256 crypto engine built into the the DMA path between the flash storage and main system memory. The device's unique ID (UID) and a device group ID (GID) are AES 256bit keys fused or compiled into the application processor and Secure Enclave during fabrication. These keys are inaccessible by either software or hardware and only the output of encryption or decryption operations is readable.\\
	UIDs are unique each iOS device and are not recorded by Apple or its suppliers. GIDs are common to all processors in a class of devices. UIDs bind data cryptographically to a device, so if memory chips are mounted on another device the files will still be inaccessible. Besides the UID and GID,
	all other cryptographic keys are created by the systems Random Number generator built into the hardware. Entropy is generated from timing variations during boot and from interrupt timing once the device has booted.\\
	Secure erasing of stored keys is equally important as creating them and iOS devices use a feature called Effaceable Storage for secure data erasure. This directly accesses and erase a small number of blocks at the hardware level using the underlying storage technology.}
	\item[]{File Data Protection: iOS uses a feature called Data Protection to protect data stored in flash memory. On creating a file on the data partition, Data Protection creates a new 256bit key for this file and uses the hardware AES engine to encrypt the file as it is written to flash memory. The per-file key is wrapped with one of several class keys, depending on the circumstances under which the file should be accessible. This wrapped per-file key is stored in the file's metadata.\\
	On opening the file the metadata is decrypted with the file system key to retrieve the wrapped per-file key. The per-file key is unwrapped with the class key which gives us the 256bit per-file key. This is then given to the AES engine which decrypts the file as it is read from memory Fig \ref{fig_ios_file_data_protection}.\\
	The File System key is generated when iOS is first installed or when the device is wiped by a user. The File System key is not intended to provide confidentiality but is designed to provide a means of quickly erasing data. Erasing the file system key renders all files cryptographically inaccessible.}
\begin{figure}[h] \label{fig_ios_file_data_protection}
	\includegraphics{file_data_protection}
	\centering
	\caption{File Data protection architecture\cite{apple_ios_security_internals}} 
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier
	\item[]{Passcodes: iOS supports four-digit passcodes and arbitary length alphanumeric passcodes. In addition	to unlocking the device, a passcode provides entropy for certain encryption keys. Certain Data protection classes require a passcode to access data, thus providing security to devices under under the attackers possession.}
	\item[]{Data Protection Classes: These are policies enforced by iOS to determine when data is accessible. There are four main classes described in the table below
	\begin{center} 
		\begin{tabular}{|cp{0.5\textwidth}|cp{0.5\textwidth}|}      
			\hline
			Data Protection Class & Description \\
			\hline \hline 
			Complete \\(NSFileProtectionComplete) & The class key is protected with a key derived from the user passcode and the device UID. Once the device is locked the decrypted class key is discarded, rendering all data in this class inaccessibel until the device is unlocked with the passcode or via Touch ID  \\
			\hline
			Protected Unless Open \\ (NSFileProtectionCompleteUnlessOpen) &  Files that need to be written while the device is locked use this class. An example is a file downloading in the background. \\
			\hline
			Protected Until First User Authentication \\ (NSFileProtectionCompleteUnitlFirstUserAuthentication) & This class behaves in the same way as Complete Protection, except that the decrypted class key is not removed from memory when the device is locked. This is the default class for all third-party app data not otherwise assigned to a Data Protection class. \\
			\hline
			NoProtection \\ (NSFileProtectionNone) &  This class key is protected only with the UID, and is
			kept in Effaceable Storage. Since all the keys needed to decrypt files in this class are
			stored on the device, the encryption only affords the benefit of fast remote wipe.\\
			
			\hline %a line at the bottom
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center} 
		
	}
	\item[]{Keychain data protection: iOS keychain provides a sure container to store sensitive data such as credentials, login tokens, certificates etc. The keychain is implemented as a single SQLite database which is stored on the file system. the securityd daemon determines which keychain items each process or app can access.\\
	Keychain data is protected using a class structure similar to the one used in file Data Protection. This is summarised in the table below \cite{Tyrone:2015:MAHH}.
	\begin{center} 
		\begin{tabular}{|cp{0.5\textwidth}|cp{0.5\textwidth}|}      
			\hline
			Keychain Protection Class & Description \\
			\hline \hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleAlways & The keychain item is always accessible.  \\
			\hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked & The keychain item is accessible only when the device is unlocked. \\
			\hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlock & The keychain item is only accessible after the first unlock from boot. \\
			\hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleAlwaysThisDeviceOnly & The keychain item is always accessible but cannot be migrated to other devices.\\
			\hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly & The keychain item is only accessible when the device is unlocked and may not be migrated to other devices.\\
			\hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly & The keychain item is accessible after the first unlock from boot and may not be migrated to other devices.\\
			\hline
			kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly & Only allows you to store keychain items if a passcode is set on the device.
			These items are accessible only when a passcode is set; if the password is later unset, they cannot be decrypted.\\
			\hline %a line at the bottom
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	}
	\item[]{Keybags: The keys for both file and keychain Data Protection classes are collected and managed in keybags. iOS uses the following four keybags: system, backup, escrow, and iCloud Backup.
	\begin{center} 
		\begin{tabular}{|cp{0.5\textwidth}|cp{0.5\textwidth}|}      
			\hline
			Keybag & Description \\
			\hline \hline
			System keybag & The class keys used in normal operation of the device are stored. For example, when a passcode is entered, the NSFileProtectionComplete key is loaded from the system keybag and unwrapped.  \\
			\hline
			Backup keybag & Created when an encrypted backup is made by iTunes and stored on
			the computer to which the device is backed up. A new keybag is created with a new
			set of keys, and the backed-up data is re-encrypted to these new keys. \\
			\hline
			Escrow keybag & This keybag allows iTunes to back
			up and sync without requiring the user to enter a passcode, and it allows an MDM server to remotely clear a user’s passcode. It is stored on the computer that’s used to sync with iTunes, or on the MDM server that manages the device. \\
			\hline
			iCloud Backup keybag & Similar to the backup keybag, all the class keys in this keybag are asymmetric so iCloud backups can be performed in the background\\
			\hline %a line at the bottom
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}	
	}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{\textbf{App security}}
Application security is critical for any smartphone security model and iOS is no exception. iOS ensures that apps are signed and verified and are sandboxed to protect user data. The salient features of app security are summarised below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{App code signing: To ensure that all apps come from a trusted source and has not been tampered with, iOS requires that all executable code be signed using an Apple-issued certificate. Apps that are part of stock iOS are signed by Apple. Mandatory code signing extends the concept of chain of trust from the OS to apps, and prevents third-party apps from loading unsigned code resources or using self-modifying code.\\
	In addition to code signing, every app submitted to the app store is vetted by Apple before being made publicly available.Unlike other mobile platforms, iOS does not allow users to install potentially malicious unsigned apps from websites, or run untrusted code. At runtime, code signature checks of all executable memory pages are made as they are loaded to ensure that an app has not been modified since it was installed or last updated.}
	\item[]{Process sandboxing:All third-party apps are “sandboxed,” so they are restricted from accessing files stored by other apps or from making changes to the device. This prevents apps from gathering or modifying information stored by other apps. Each app has a unique home directory	for its files, which is randomly assigned when the app is installed. If a third-party app	needs to access information other than its own, it does so only by using services explicitly provided by iOS.\\
	System files and resources are also shielded from the user’s apps. The majority of iOS runs as the non-privileged user “mobile,” as do all third-party apps. The entire OS partition is mounted as read-only. Unnecessary tools, such as remote login services, aren’t included in the system software, and APIs do not allow apps to escalate their own privileges to modify other apps or iOS itself.}
	\item[]{Exploit Mitigations: Address space layout randomization (ASLR) protects against the exploitation of	memory corruption bugs. Built-in apps use ASLR to ensure that all memory regions are randomized upon launch. Randomly arranging the memory addresses of executable	code, system libraries, and related programming constructs reduces the likelihood of many sophisticated exploits.\\
	Further protection is provided by iOS using ARM’s Execute Never (XN) feature, which marks memory pages as non-executable. Memory pages marked as both writable and executable can be used only by apps under tightly controlled conditions: The kernel checks for the presence of the Apple-only dynamic code-signing entitlement}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Current malware landscape}
Although an overwhelming majority of smartphone malware targets Android. There have been a few malware families targeting iOS \cite{current_ios_malware}\cite{ios_malware_exists}. As iOS imporves its market share we predict an increase in malware families targeting iOS.

\section{Malware Analysis Process} \label{process}
In this section we look at the goals of malware analysis and what are the question that need to be answered in the analysis report. We also present our generalized approach to analysing malware on smartphones and a potential report template to document the analysis.

\subsection{Goals of Malware Analysis}
The goal of malware analysis is to allow us to answer the following questions \cite{kris:practical_malware_analysis}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{\textbf{What is the purpose of the malware?}}
	\item[]{\textbf{How did it infect the system?}}
	\item[]{\textbf{Who are the attackers and what are the resources at their disposal?}}
	\item[]{\textbf{What did it steal?}}
	\item[]{\textbf{How long has it been here?}}
	\item[]{\textbf{What are the capabilities of this malware?}}
	\item[]{\textbf{How do we identify this malware in the future?}}
\end{itemize}
Malware examination is composed of simple and complex tasks. These tasks can be broadly categorized as into four stages\cite{zeltser:analysis_stages}. These four stages are illustrated in \ref{fig_malware_analysis_stages} as a pyramid. At the bottom of the pyramid we have the easier tasks such which can be done by open source or commercially available tools but offers limited insight into the malware being analysed. As we move higher up the pyramid, the analysis gets more involved requiring a lot more effort and specialized skill set.
\begin{figure}[h] \label{fig_malware_analysis_stages}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stages_of_malware_analysis}
	\centering
	\caption{Four stages of malware analysis\cite{zeltser:analysis_stages}} 
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier 

The four stages can be summarised as follows
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{Fully-automated analysis:} This is the easiest stage of malware analysis. It involves scanning the suspected sample with automated tools. These tools are designed to analyse a large number of samples and identify the ones that are potentially malicious. This saves the analyst time in having to manually analyse each sample. However these tools are not absolutely accurate and there can be cases of false-negatives and false-positives.}
	\item{\textbf{Static properties analysis:} This stage invlolves examining the sample without having to actually execute the code. This include analysing strings embedded into the file, header details, hashes, embedded resources, packer signatures, metadata such as the creation date, permissions requested, signing certificates, etc.}
	\item{\textbf{Interactive behaviour analysis:} This stage involves allowing the sample to execute within an isolated environment to observe its behaviour. This stage allows the analyst to study network communications, file operations, processes execution and utilization of system resources.}
	\item{\textbf{Manual code reversing:} This is the final stage in malware analysis and involves reverse engineering the malware sample and analysing the source code. Code analysis is time consuming and burdensome, however it reveals malware capabilities that might not be observable from behaviour analysis.}	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Generalized analysis approach} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{We begin by analysing the sample with automated tools. A variety of tools exist that can be run both locally and from the web. Some malware samples are designed to evade certain automated tools, therefore it is advised to use multiple tools to analyse the sample.}
\item{The reports from the automated tools provide early indications of the samples maliciousness. However sophisticated malware have been known to use analysis evasion techniques to deceive automated tools. The analyst is therefore advised to consider other parameters in their analysis such as the origins of the sample, the frequency of the samples occurrence, etc.}
\item{The next step in the analysis process is \textit{static analysis}. We analyse the samples metadata,embedded resources, executables and other artefacts. The executables are decompiled/disassembled to retrieve the source/assembly which the analyst can then statically examine for malicious behaviour. Guidelines to static analysis are described in section \ref{gen_static_analysis_guide}.}
\item{Many samples now use several methods of obfuscation to slow down if not thwart reverse engineering. In such circumstances we first try to identify the packer being used and try to find a deobfuscator for that packer. A times the packer is not known or tools to deobfuscate the packer may not exist yet. The analyst would then have to manually unpack the executable either by hand or by building custom scripts.}
\item{Having completed our static analysis, we move towards understanding the behaviour of the sample with \textit{dynamic analysis}. The first step is to provision sandboxes for the samples targeted platform. The sample is executed within the sandbox to observe its network communication, interactions with the file-system, memory space and other device resource utilization. Guidlines to dynamic analysis are described in section \ref{gen_dynamic_analysis_guide}.}
\item{Additionally we may wish to debug the running sample within the sandbox to learn more about its behaviour that might not be immediately apparent from just black box observations. Activities such as analysis evasion techniques, persistence techniques and deobfuscation routines reveal themselves when tracing the samples execution. This information can then be used to tweak the properties of the sandbox to defeat evasion techniques.}
\item{On completion of the previous steps we generate a report to summarize the analysis and document artefacts of interest along with supporting data such as logfiles, network captures, screenshots, etc.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Guidelines to creating sandboxes}
Sandbox creation and provisioning is one of the first steps in setting up a malware analysis lab. A sandbox should provide visibility, resistance to detection and scalability \cite{lastline:building_effective_sandbox}. Visibility implies that the sandbox should enable the analyst to view as much of the malware execution as possible. Secondly the sandbox must be provisioned so as to make it increasingly difficult for malware to identify its presence. Lastly it should be possible to generate multiple sandboxes so as to analyse multiple malware samples simultaneously without interference in the analysis.\\
The two options available for sandbox creation for smartphones are using physical sandboxes and emulated sandboxes. Physical sandboxes provide higher resistance to detection over emulated sandboxes but scalability is difficult. Emulated sandboxes offer greater scalability and visibility due to the flexibility they provide from its software implementation. However additional work needs to be done to make it resistant to detection. Emulators tend to provide only a subset of the underlying platform's capabilities and not complete functionality. For example emulators allow mocking phone calls but not sending and receiving actual phone calls. This makes it easy for malware to detect such sandboxes.We suggest that the analyst create both physical and emulated sandboxes to analyse malware. Additionally the sandbox should have capabilities to extract artefacts of interest such as databases, logfiles, memory dumps, etc to the analysis workstation.
 
\subsection{Guidelines to static analysis} \label{gen_static_analysis_guide}
Static analysis allows us to examine a sample without having to execute it. This section provides some guidelines on what to look for while performing static analysis.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Given a sample identify the file type and the platform it targets. Smartphone applications are generally archives that contain executable files and other resources. Extract and examine its contents. Look for abnormal file names and anomalies in the modified, accessed and created timestamps. This helps to some extent in identifying repackaged applications.}
	\item{Compute MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and Fuzzy hashes so as to compare them with existing malware databases or to detect a repackaged app from its original.}
	\item{Generally apps are required to be signed before they are installed on the device. Obtaining signing information from certificates included in the application bundle could help identify the authors and/or origins of the sample.}
	\item{Identify permissions requested by the application (e.g. AndroidManifest.xml found in Android applications).}
	\item{Analyze app contents for embedded strings and payloads within binaries and other resource files. Android malware authors have been known to embed payloads within resources \cite{strazzere:dex_education}}.
	\item{A major part of static analysis is decompiling the binaries to reveal the source code. When analysing the source we look for sensitive function calls, communication patterns (TCP,HTTP,SMS etc), encryption/decryption routines and keys, Encoding (e.g. Base64) and interaction with the file system. Malware authors use several tricks to make it harder if not thwart code inspection. Some methods are obfuscation, encryption and triggering exceptions in reversing tools \cite{strazzere:dex_education}. Analyst are advised to use multiple tools for code inspection and not rely on a single tool. Obfuscation and encryption may slow down the analysis and it may be prudent to attempt dynamic analysis before attempting deobfuscation.}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Guidelines to dynamic analysis} \label{gen_dynamic_analysis_guide}
Dynamic analysis involves executing the sample in a sandbox to observe its behaviour. The first order of business is to have a dedicated workstation solely for analysis and connected to an isolated network. This is a fail-safe measure incase the malware sample escapes the sandbox. We are not aware of known smartphone malware that is known to escape sanboxes but such sophistication could be implemented in the future. The behaviours to observe are listed as follows
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{Network Communication:} The analysis workstation should be configured to act as a proxy from network traffic from the sandboxes. This includes both physical and emulated sandboxes. By proxying traffic to the workstation it makes it easier to setup traffic monitoring tools and other traffic injection utilities.\\
	When observing traffic patterns look for connections to unknown hosts, data being transmitted between host and sandbox and attempt to identify the communication protocol.}
	\item{\textbf{File operations:} Observing file operations such as files deployed and files being read from and written to give clues on the data being processes by the application and other operational dependencies.}
	\item{\textbf{Application tracing:} This allows the analyst to attach a debugger to the running sample to trace its execution and access to resources being used, such as file handles, network operations, memory addresses etc.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Generating an analysis report}
The malware analysis report typically consists of the following sections \cite{zeltser:malwarereport} \cite{soni:malware_report}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item[]{\textbf{Executive Summary:} This section should summarise and highlight the key-points of the analysis. The reader of the report should get a gist of the specimens nature, capabilities, mode of infection and other relevant characteristics.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Identification:} This should include name, size, hashes (MD5, SHA-1 and Fuzzy hashes), packer information,  obfuscator information, known aliases if any, etc.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Capabilities:} This section should describe the capabilities of the malware such as permissions requested and used, data leakage, interaction with the attacker, analysis evasion mechanism, etc.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Dependencies:} This includes any network or file resources that the malware is dependent on for its execution, minimum and maximum version of operating system and other platform dependencies.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Behavioural and Code analysis findings:} This section documents the observations made during behavioural and code analysis. }
	\item[]{\textbf{Supporting data:} This consists of log files, screenshots, network traffic captures, function listings, string excerpts and other artefacts that support the investigation.}
	\item[]{\textbf{Incident Recommendations:} This is section provides indicators for detecting the malware on other systems.}
\end{itemize}
A template for the analysis report can be found in Appendix \ref{analysis_report_template}.

\section{Analysing Android Malware} \label{android_malware_analysis}
Of all the extant smartphone platforms Android has been the most popular target for malware. This section provides an implementation of the proposed malware analysis for Android.
\subsection{Sandbox creation}
This section describes the process of creating and provisioning physical and virtual sandboxes, configuring the network and setting up application tracing. The following steps serve as a guide to setting up the environment.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Get a android smartphone that's capable of running the last two releases of Android.  either by purchasing it or by installing a custom ROM. The phone needs to be rooted so as to allow privileged applications to run such as network captures, exploring the file system, etc. Installing superSU and Busybox on the device lets us use multiple UNIX utilities on the android platform.}
	\item{Download and install the Android SDK and update it with the latest tools, Pltaform-tools and build-tools.}
	\item{Install Android Studio and have it point to the installed sdk}
	\item{Using the Android SDK manager install the platform APIs and System images for the last two releases of Android}	
	\item{The system images can be either ARM EABI and/or Intel x86}
	\item{Emulators can be created using the Android Device Manager (AVD) that comes bundled along with the Android SDK or by using a third party emulator such as Genymotion. We recommend using Genymotion as it is faster than the standard Android emulator as its based on VirtualBox. However the free version of Genymotion has limited capabilities so you may consider upgrading to a licensed version.}
	\item{Once the emulators have been created we install tools for network and data capture. To capture call logs and SMS/MMS data we install viaForensics AFLogical OSE and for network capture we install Root-to-Shark which is a wrapper for UNIX utility tcpdump.}
	\item{The sandbox needs to be populated with dummy data to mimic user data before we being analysis and then wiped after the analysis concludes. In order to save time from having to repopulate the data, using a Backup and Restore app is recommended.}
	\item{The apps installed on the emulator for network capture, call and SMS/MMS extraction, and Backup and Restore should also be installed on the physical sandbox. Additionally ensure that USB debugging and Stay awake features are enabled along with installation of apps from unknown sources.}
	\item{The network configuration for both emulated and physical devices should use the proxy setup on the analysis workstation.}
	\item{On the analysis workstation we install BurpSuite for HTTP proxying, FakeDNS to spoof DNS replies, Wireshark to analyse network captures from the sandboxes, SQLite Browser to inspect an applicaitons SQLite databases and Android Studio to perform application tracing.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analysing Malware}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Upload the sample to some of the online analysis services mentioned below or search their hashes on the internet using your favourite search engine.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item{Virus total}
			\item{Andrubis}
			\item{Joe Sandbox apk-analyzer.net}
			\item{Dexter}
			\item{CopperDroid}
			\item{ForeSafe}
			\item{Metascan (www.metascan-online.com)}
		\end{itemize}
	This would give us an indication on the maliciousness of the sample and other information regarding its capabilities and internal structure.
	}
	\item{Unpack the apk and examine its contents. Review the permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml, the various activites, services, boradcast receivers and content provider definitions.}
	\item{Review signing certificate information found in the META-INF folder.}
	\item{Inspect embedded strings using the \textit{file} utility found on most linux distributions for anything that might be suspicious}
	\item{Inspect resource files for embedded payloads.}
	\item{Decompile classes.dex to java bytecode using dex2jar. This jar file can then be reversed to java source using tools such as jd or jadx. The starting point for inspection should be the main activity listed in AndroidManifest.xml}
	\item{From analysing the code create a hypothesis on what the sample might doing.}
	\item{With our findings from static analysis such as permissions, suspect code and other artefacts we develop test scenarios to observe under dynamic analysis. We begin by installing the sample into the emulated sandbox and physical sandbox.}
	\item{Note the files deployed to the filesystem when the apk is installed. This would generally be found in the /data/data/<application name> folder.}
	\item{Start network capture either within the sandbox or on the proxy server.}
	\item{Execute a test scenario and observe its behaviour. Document observations and extract and preserve relevant data.}
	\item{Repeat the previous step until all test cases have been executed.}
	\item{Application tracing can be done using Android Studio and the Dalvik Debug Monitor (DDMS).Debugging on an emulator allows access to all running processes. However on physical devices, application debugging should be enabled within the sample.}
	\item{If applicaiton debugging is not enabled, simply decompile the apk using apktool, Append the attribute \textit{android:debuggable=true} to the applicaiton tag in AndroidManifest.xml and rebuild the apk. The repacked apk should now run in debug mode.}
	\item{Create a analysis report}
\end{enumerate}
