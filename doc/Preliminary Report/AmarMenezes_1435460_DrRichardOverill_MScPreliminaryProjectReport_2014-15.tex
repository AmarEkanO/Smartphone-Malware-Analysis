\begin{abstract} 
	 This project aims to develop a process for malware analysis on an Android, iOS or Windows phone. This process would allow law enforcement, incident response teams and security researchers to efficiently analyse a given smartphone for malware and provide a technical summary of its capabilities, origins, the system weaknesses that it exploits and potential criminal activities.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Why is there a need for this process?\\}}
	Over the last decade there has been a significant shift in computing from Desktops to mobile computing devices. Of these devices smartphones and tablets take up a large part of the market share. The growing popularity of these devices have caught the attention of malware writers. As everyday users rely on their devices for activities such as e-commerce, communication, navigation etc. There is a huge incentive for cyber criminals to exploit such devices that have weak security in place.
	\item{\textbf{Who benefits from the process?\\}}
	Malware is non-geographic, and can be orchestrated from any part of the world. Malware is a growing area as criminals look for financial gain with minimal risk. A robust set of processes
	to deal with malware on Smartphones will ensure that any criminal activity is detected and identified.
