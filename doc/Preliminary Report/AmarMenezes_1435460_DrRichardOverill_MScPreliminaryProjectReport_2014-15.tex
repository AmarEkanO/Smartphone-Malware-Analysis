\begin{abstract} 
	 This project aims to develop a process for malware analysis on an Android, iOS or Windows phone. This process would allow law enforcement, incident response teams and security researchers to efficiently analyse a given smartphone for malware and provide a technical summary of its capabilities, origins, the system weaknesses that it exploits and potential criminal activities.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Why is there a need for this process?\\}}
	Over the last decade there has been a significant shift in computing from Desktops to mobile computing devices. Of these devices smartphones and tablets take up a large part of the market share. The growing popularity of these devices have caught the attention of malware writers. As everyday users rely on their devices for activities such as e-commerce, communication, navigation etc. There is a huge incentive for cyber criminals to exploit such devices that have weak security in place.
	\item{\textbf{Who benefits from the process?\\}}
	Malware is non-geographic, and can be orchestrated from any part of the world. Malware is a growing area as criminals look for financial gain with minimal risk. A robust set of processes to deal with malware on Smartphones will ensure that any criminal activity is detected and identified.
	\item{\textbf{Where and How will this process be used?\\}}
	This process can be used by law enforcement or incident response teams to assist in the reconstruction of events by malware and to gather forensic evidence to be used in legal prosecution. This process can also be used by security researchers in discovery and analysis of malicious software. The aim of the project is to develop a process for malware analysis on Android, iOS or Windows smartphones. This process would aid in e-discovery by identifying malware, its method of distribution and propagation, the security weaknesses that it exploits and the malicious activities it perpetrates.
\end{itemize}
\section{Related Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{What has currently been done in the field?}}
	Researchers have attempted to generate surveys on existing smartphone malware since 2007. Most of this work has been on classifying Android malware and very little on iOS or Windows. This is partly due to the reason that Apple and Microsoft review each app submitted to their app markets so there is a slim chance that malware can slip through. However this has occured in some occasions in the past. Jailbroken iPhones allow installation of apps from third party sources. This is been the most popular method of malware distribution on jailbroken iPhones.

\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
		\item{\textbf{Project objectives?}}
		\item{\textbf{Scope of the project?}}
\end{itemize}

\section{Specification}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Smartphone platforms covered?}
	The process would primarily be designed for the analysis of Android malware but can also be extended to analyze iOS and Windows phone malware.
	\item{Operating systems covered for each platform?}
	For Android we cover versions 4.1.x (Jelly Bean) through 5.0 (Lollipop) and for iOS we cover 8.x.
	\item{Methods of detection and analysis}
	Analysis would involve both dynamic and static analysis.
	\item{Reporting}
	The process would allow the generation of a report containing the technical details of the malware, its origin, its capabilities and how it is being used to commit crime. It would also identify the security weakness that facilitated infection.
