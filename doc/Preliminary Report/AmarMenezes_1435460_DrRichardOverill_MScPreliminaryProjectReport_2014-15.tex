\begin{abstract} 
	 This project aims to develop a process for malware analysis on an Android, iOS or Windows phone. This process would allow law enforcement, incident response teams and security researchers to efficiently analyse a given smartphone for malware and provide a technical summary of its capabilities, origins, the system weaknesses that it exploits and potential criminal activities.
