\section{Summary}
\textbf{Tasks Completed:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{A survey of existing malware families for Android.}
	\item{The process template was updated to include Internet based analysis services for Android malware. Services include VirusTotal, Andrubis and CopperDroid}
	\item{A toolkit of Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) for static analysis of Android malware has been compiled. Tools include dex2jar, jd-gui, androguard and apktool}
	\item{A toolkit of FOSS for dynamic analysis of Android malware has been compiled. Tools include Drozer, DroidScope, Wireshark and Burpsuite.}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{In Progress:}
\begin{enumerate}
		\item{Provisioning of physical and virtual Android devices to perform malware analysis in a controlled environment.}
	    \item{Detailed documentation of the analysis process, including best practices.}
		\item{Create a template for the analysis report. The report would contain an executive summary and technical details of the analysis performed.}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{To be started:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{Request access to the Android Malware Genome project and review its research. http://www.malgenomeproject.org/}
	\item{Case study of known Android malware samples}
	\item{A survey of analysis evasion techniques used by malware and how to counter them}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Changes:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{It was initially decided to perform analysis of iOS malware. However it proved difficult to procure hardware and software for the analysis of iOS. This led to the focus being primarily on Android since tools and hardware were available and 98\% of smartphone malware targets the Android platform.}
\end{enumerate}
